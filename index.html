    <h2 class="first">The Story of Henry</h2>
    <p class="story">Kcd 2 is a story driven game, where you can play as Henry of Saklitz, a local blacksmiths boy, but soon his life get turned upside down when the cuman army of Sigismund attacks your village and murders your "father". Henry swors revenge against them (but most of that is left up for this game to take care of). In a shocking turn of events you find out that your real father isn't the local blacksmith, but the Lord of Saklitz Radzig Kobila. The game has a prequel, but you dont need to play the first game to play the second, because the developers made sure that you are caught up to par with the games story. You start the game right after the ending of the first one, delivering a letter to a certain lord of Troskowitz, but fate has a funny way of getting your plans wrecked. The letter is only the start of the new adventure, where you can explore new places, and immerse yourself in them.</p>
