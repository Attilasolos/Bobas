    <p class="paragarph">Kcd 2 is a story driven game, where you can play as Henry of Saklitz, a local blacksmiths boy, but soon his life get turned upside down when the cuman army of Sigismund attacks your village and murders your "father". Henry swors revenge against them (but most of that is left up for this game to take care of). In a shocking turn of events you find out that your real father isn't the local blacksmith, but the Lord of Saklitz Radzig Kobila. The game has a prequel, but you dont need to play the first game to play the second, because the developers made sure that you are caught up to par with the games story. You start the game right after the ending of the first one, delivering a letter to a certain lord of Troskowitz, but fate has a funny way of getting your plans wrecked. The letter is only the start of the new adventure, where you can explore new places, and immerse yourself in them.</p>

        <p class="paragarph">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is widely praised for its dedication to historical realism, capturing the look and feel of early 15th-century Bohemia with impressive accuracy. From its meticulously reconstructed towns and castles to the realistic combat and social customs, nearly every detail reflects careful historical research. The developers collaborated with historians to ensure authenticity, avoiding magic or fantasy and instead focusing on the harsh, grounded realities of medieval life. Though some aspects are adjusted for gameplay balance and narrative flow, it remains one of the most authentic and immersive representations of the medieval world in gaming. </p>
